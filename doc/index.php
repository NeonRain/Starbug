	<dt>What is it?</dt>
	<dd>A web development framework, well i'm calling it a Request Engine</dd>
	<dt>What does it do?</dt>
	<dd>It provides a layer of abstraction to web development to facilitate database management and interaction, templatization, and form generation, among other things. The aim is to drastically increase development productivity</dd>
	<dt>That means nothing to me, i'm assuming it makes making websites easier or it makes something easier?</dt>
	<dd>Well when ever you input data into a website it is into a form, and whenever data is saved or retrieved it is from a database</dd>
	<dt>OK. So this makes that more efficient?</td>
	<dd>Yes because rather than deal with raw database interaction you deal with object models like Users, Posts, and Events
and rather than writing out lots of form code, you use these object models to generate forms</dd>
